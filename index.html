					<h4><b>Important <i>Natrelle</i><sup>&reg;</sup> Breast Implants Safety Information</b></h4>
					
					<h5>Indications</h5>
				    <ul>
  				    <li><b>Breast Augmentation for women at least 22 years old.</b> Breast augmentation includes primary breast augmentation to increase the breast size, as well as revision surgery to correct or improve the result of a primary breast augmentation surgery</li>
						</ul>
				</div>
					
					<div class=" cover columns two">

  					<ul>
							<li><b>Breast Reconstruction.</b> Breast reconstruction includes primary reconstruction to replace breast tissue that has been removed due to cancer or trauma or that has failed to develop properly due to a severe breast abnormality. Breast reconstruction also includes revision surgery to correct or improve the result of a primary breast reconstruction surgery
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h5 class="section">Contraindications</h5>
						<p><b>Breast implant surgery should NOT be performed in:</b></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Women with active infection anywhere in their body.</li>
							<li>Women with existing cancer or pre-cancer of their breast who have not received adequate treatment for those conditions.</li>
							<li>Women who are currently pregnant or nursing.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<h5 class="section">Warnings</h5>
						<p><b>Every effort should be made to avoid damage to the breast implants during surgery.</b></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Care should be taken to avoid the use of excessive force and to minimize handling of the implant during surgical insertion.</li>
							<li>Care should be taken when using surgical instruments in proximity with the breast implant, including scalpel, sutures, and dissection instrumentation.</li>
							<li>Use care in subsequent procedures such as open capsulotomy, breast pocket revision, hematoma/seroma aspiration, and biopsy/lumpectomy to avoid damage to the implant.</li>
							<li>Do not contact the implant with disposable, capacitor-type cautery devices.</li>
							<li>Do not alter the implants or attempt to repair or insert a damaged prosthesis.</li>
							<li>Do not immerse the implant in <i>Betadine</i><sup>&reg;</sup> solution.</li>
							<li>Do not re-use or resterilize any product that has been previously implanted.  Breast implants are intended for single use only.</li>
							<li>Do not place more than one implant per breast pocket.</li>
							<li>Do not use the periumbilical approach to place the implant.</li>
							<li>Do not use microwave diathermy in patients with breast implants, as it has been reported to cause tissue necrosis, skin erosion, and implant extrusion.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<h5 class="section">Precautions</h5>
						<p><b>Safety and effectiveness have not been established in patients with the following:</b></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Autoimmune diseases (for example, lupus and scleroderma)</li>
							<li>A weakened immune system (for example, currently taking drugs that weaken the body's natural resistance to disease)</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>Planned chemotherapy following breast implant placement</li>
              <li>Planned radiation therapy to the breast following breast implant placement</li>
              <li>Conditions that interfere with wound healing and blood clotting</li>
              <li>Reduced blood supply to breast tissue</li>
              <li>Clinical diagnosis of depression or other mental health disorders, including body dysmorphic
                disorder and eating disorders. Please discuss any history of mental health disorders with your surgeon
                prior to surgery. Patients with a diagnosis of depression, or other mental health disorders, should wait

    				<h5 class="section">Contraindications</h5>
    				<p>The <i>Natrelle</i><sup>&reg;</sup> Tissue Expanders are contraindicated in patients with:</p>
